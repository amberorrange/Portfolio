        <h1> About Me</h1>
        <p>I’m a former professional basketball player turned software engineer. I’ve played 5 years in Germany, Italy, and Israel and graduated from Stanford University with a B.A. in Science, Technology, and Society. Through my unique professional journey, I understand the value of having a high work ethic, perseverance through adversity, working within a team, and communicating and collaborating with others. As I make the transition into software engineering, I look forward to bringing these skills, as well as my love of problem solving, attention to detail, and excitement about the possibilities of tech that software engineering brings. What I enjoy about software engineering is that there is always more to learn- I’ve learned that no one knows everything. I love how you break down larger, challenging problems into smaller, doable parts, and I find it rewarding to push through something that’s initially challenging and find a solution. There is also satisfaction in being able to tangibly see the results of your work and seeing the impact that the work you do can have. I’m excited to grow and expand my knowledge base in the field and am looking to bring that excitement to learn and contribute to a company that is enthusiastic about what they do and that I can learn from.

        <h1>Project</h1>
        <h2>Backlog Tracker</h2>
        <p>Description: Backlog Tracker is a full-stack web app designed to help video game enthusiasts keep track of the games they want to play. The app allows users to search for games and add them to their backlog, which displays data such as the game’s title, description, genre, platform, etc. Games can be organized according to different filters and sorted according to user preference. The app provides a way to add reviews, where players submit the number or hours that they played a game. The app analyzes the data from reviews and uses it to display user statistics, which include the total number of hours played, the percentage they’ve played per genre or platform, along with other relevant information.
